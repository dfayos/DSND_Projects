## Project 1 - Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations

In this project, I used exploratory data analysis techniques, a supervised ML model (Logistic Regression) and a Kaggle dataset containing over 100k hotel booking records. The project objective was to provide information about price sensitivy to time of the year and lead time, as well as the predictability of booking cancellations.
