# Project: Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations

## Overview

This project explores the world of hotel bookings, in particular the variability of pricing (expressed as average daily rates per booking) and the cancellation events for those bookings.

## Goals

We aim to provide some answers to the following questions:
* How does hotel pricing vary over time? How much cheaper is to travel in the quieter winter months, compared to the summer months?
* Is it better to book far in advance? or should we book last minute?
* How many cancellations can the hotel expect? Can we predict what bookings are going to be cancelled?

We will try to use various exploratory analysis techniques and a Logistic Regression classifier, a type of Supervised Machine Learning model.

## Software requirements

* [Jupyter](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter) is required to run the Jupyter notebook offline.
*  Numpy, Pandas Python libraries required for the data analysis
*  Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries required for visualization
*  sklearn (scikit-learn) library required for the Machine Learning model implementation.

All of the above are part of the standard [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution.

## Data

Our only data source for this analysis will be the [Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

This dataset consists of a single csv file ```hotel_bookings.csv``` (available in this repository, or in the Kaggle link above).
